# Identity-access-Management
The goal of this project is to design and implement a secure Identity and Access Management system. The system enables centralized management of users, roles, and permissions, while enforcing strong authentication mechanisms such as Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA).
